# AudioRun

Final group project for CS 4590 Computer Audio at Georgia Tech. We implemented a way to interface a Samsung Gear S3 with a Android app to extract raw heart rate data. This helped provide environmental context for our prototype app that sonified workout cues. 

Android app was built with Android Studio v3.3.2+ coded in Java and tested on a Google Pixel 2 XL running Android 9+.

Samsung watchapp was built with Tizen Studio IDE v3.2+ coded in JavaScript with the Samsung Accessory SDK extension and tested on a Samsung Gear S3 Frontier.
